        <h1> Roni
        </h1>
        <p>Roni is a well-rounded person who has many surprising experiences and skills. She grew up in the Bay Area of California, learning her love for the outdoors at a young age. This led her to her dream job after college, working as an Outdoor Educator and Gardender at a Residential Outdoor School in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Once the pandemic occurred, Roni was forced to change course and saw it as an opportunity to start over. Since then she has honed her skills working in kitchens, lumber mills, childcare programs, farms, dance studios, and more. She is an avid lover of frisbee, hiking, playing guitar, eating fresh baked sourdough, and deep conversation. </p>

        I looked down at the board. "The point isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a beautiful game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"

            <h1>Forget the stockpile of wood; what about the stock of partial projects?</h1>

                <h3>When building furniture, some woodworkers keep a stockpile of lumber on hand and draw from their stacks as they begin a new project. Others buy enough lumber (with some extra) for each piece they are planning to build, often working from a list that includes all the pieces in a given project and their rough dimensions. I work in a different way.</h3>

                <h3>I start with a log and split out almost every piece of oak that I use at the bench. Starting with the log is a lot of work, but its even more fun. When I split open a log, I have an idea of what my needs are, but the log often has ideas of its own. If I have a particularly large diameter, straight-grained example, then I split out and stockpile wide panels for joined work, even if I have no immediate need for panels. This approach usually results in my starting several projects at once, then leapfrogging back and forth between them.
                <h3>Sometimes there are quite a few pieces underway, usually limited by shop space. When I was preparing to move my shop a year ago, I had a joined chest, a chest with drawers, a chest of drawers, two wainscot chairs, a long table and several joint stools. I finished a carved box in the midst of all these.</h3>

                <h3>Most of those I finished up so I didnt have to move them. Some got stalled (the chest with drawers and the chest of drawers). Ive just been back in a shop for two months and have revived those two pieces and made a large box with a drawer. Then the floodgates opened.
                I now have underway the two chests, a carved box, two more wainscot chairs, a joined stool and the beginnings of two joined carved chests.</h3>
